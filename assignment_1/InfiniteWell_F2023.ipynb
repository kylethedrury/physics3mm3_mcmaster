    "In this notebook we will be solving the infinite symmetric well using what is called the shooting method. The potential does not need to be a square well to use this method, but it is important that it is *symmetric*. To make the potential symmetric we will define $V(x)$ from $-a$ to $a$ rather than from $0$ to $a$ (as used for the infinite square well in Section 2.2 of Griffiths). Furthermore, we shall use units where $\\hbar^2/m=1$."

    "The shooting method is fairly straightforward. First we guess an energy $E$. Then we integrate from the left wall of the well, $x=-a$, where we know that $\\psi(x=-a)=0$ and $\\psi'(x=-a)\\neq 0$. We integrate up to $x=0$ (the mid-point of the well) and if the integrated function $\\psi(x=0)=0$ then we guessed correctly, and the energy $E$ is a solution (an eigenvalue). This **only** works because the well is symmetric around zero, which means that the solutions, $\\psi(x)$, will be either even or odd functions. If we require $\\psi(x=0)=0$ we obtain the odd solutions. If instead we want the even solutions, we should require $\\psi'(x=0)=0$.\n",

    "The second fact that we need is that each subsequent solution will have **one more node**. This means that if we plot $\\psi(x=0)$ **as a function of** $E$ it will change sign every time we have an energy $E$ that is a solution. Let's see how that works: We set up the calculation by taking a number of discrete points on the x-axis and a number of discrete values of $E$ stored in en. For each value of $E$ in en we then integrate up to find $\\psi(x=0)$.\n"
