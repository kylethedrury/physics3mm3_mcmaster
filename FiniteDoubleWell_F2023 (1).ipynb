    "In this exercise we will solve the Schr&ouml;dinger equation using the method described in problem 2.61 in Griffiths (3rd ed). As usual, we will use a discrete grid with spacing $h$. The second derivative can then be approximated as $(-2\\psi_j+\\psi_{j+1}+\\psi_{j-1})/h^2$. If we discretize $\\psi$ on the interval $-W,W$ in $N$ points then it is easy to see that Schr&ouml;dinger's equation becomes an eigenvalue equation for an $N\\times N$ matrix as explained in problem 2.61. We shall then be looking at problem 2.47 in Griffiths (3rd ed) using this method. This problem is concerned with studying a **Double Finite Square Well**. \n",
